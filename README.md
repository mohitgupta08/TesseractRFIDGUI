# TesseractRFIDGUI
This project will be built into a working GUI for OCR and RFID scanner meant to run in conjunction with an ardino and a webcam,  This is a senior project for Cleveland State University and made with help from Zin Technology.

This project is to do the following tasks:<br/>
1. OCR(Optical Character Recognition) of a label. <br/>
2. Reading RFID(Radio Frequency IDentification) on the label. <br/>
3. Sort the data in a meaning way. <br/>
4. Output to a TSV(tab-separated values) file. <br/>

This will all be done in a simple and easy to use GUI(graphical user interface).
